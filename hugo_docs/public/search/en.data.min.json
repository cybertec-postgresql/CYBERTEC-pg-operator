From broken storage to deployments gone wrong, backups often save the day. Starting with pg_dump, which was released in the late 1990s, to the archiving of WAL files (PostgreSQL 8.0 / 2005) and pg_basebackup (PostgreSQL 9.0 / 2010), PostgreSQL already offers built-in options for backups and restores based on logical and physical backups.\nBackups with pgBackRest CPO relies on pgBackRest as its backup solution, a tried-and-tested tool with extensive backup and restore options. The backup is based on two elements:\nSnapshots in the form of physical backups WAL archive: Continuous archiving of the WAL files Backups Backups represent a snapshot of the database in the form of pyhsical files. This contains all relevant information that PostgreSQL holds in its data folder. With pgBackRest it is possible to create different types of Backups:\nfull Snapshot: This captures and saves all files at the time of the backup Differential backup: Only captures all files that have been changed since the last full Backup Incremental backup: Only records the files that have been changed since the last backup (of any kind). When restoring using differential or incremental Backup, it is necessary to also use the previous Backup that provide the basis for the selected Backup.\nHINT: The choice of Backup types depends on factors such as the size of the database, the time available for backups and the restore.\nWAL-Archive The WAL (Write-Ahead-Log) refers to log files which record all changes to the database data before they are written to the actual files. The basic idea here is to guarantee the consistency and recoverability of the comitted data even in the event of failures.\nPostgreSQL normally cleans up or recycles the WAL files that are no longer required. By using WAL archiving, the WAL files are saved to a different location before this process so that they can be used for various activities in the future. These activities include\nProviding the WAL files for replicas to keep them up to date Restoring instances that have lost parts of the WAL files in the event of a failure and cannot return to a consistent state without them without losing data Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR): In contrast to Backups, which map a fixed point in time, WAL files make it possible to jump dynamically to a desired point in time and restore the database to the closest available consistent data point HINT: WAL archiving is an indispensable tool for data availability, recoverability and the continuous availability of PostgreSQL.\nBackup your Cluster With pgBackRest, backups can be stored on different types of storage:\nBlock storage (PVC) S3 / S3-compatible storage Azure blob storage GCS How a Backup works The operator creates a cronjob object on Kubernetes based on the defined times for automatic backups. This means that the Kubernetes core (CronJob Controller) will take care of processing the automatic backups and create a job and thus a pod at the appropriate time. The pod will send the backup command to the primary or, if block storage is used, to the repo host and monitor it. As soon as the backup is successfully completed, the pod stops with Completed and thus completes the job.\nkubectl get cronjobs --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NAME | SCHEDULE | SUSPEND | ACTIVE | LAST SCHEDULE | AGE pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-full | 30 2 * * * | False | 0 | 4h46m | 14h pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr | */30 * * * * | False | 1 | 81s | 106m kubectl get jobs ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NAME | COMPLETIONS | DURATION | AGE pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-full-28597110 | 1/1 | 52s | 140m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597365 | 1/1 | 2m37s | 32m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597380 | 1/1 | 2m38s | 17m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597395 | 0/1 | 2m3s | 2m3s If there are problems such as a timeout, the pod will stop with exit code 1 and thus indicate an error. In this case, a new pod will be created which will attempt to complete the backup. The maximum number of attempts is 6, so if the backup fails six times, the job is deemed to have failed and will not be attempted again until the next cronjob execution. The job pod log provides information about the problems.\nkubectl get pods ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NAME | READY | STATUS | RESTARTS | AGE cluster-0 | 2/2 | Running | 2 | 14h cluster-pgbackrest-repo-host-0 | 1/1 | Running | 0 | 107m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-full-28597110-x8zpw | 0/1 | Completed | 0 | 143m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597365-7bb5l | 0/1 | Completed | 0 | 34m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597380-j76rr | 0/1 | Completed | 0 | 19m pgbackrest-cluster-repo1-incr-28597395-rh86t | 0/1 | Completed | 0 | 4m27s postgres-operator-66bbff5c54-5sjmk | 1/1 | Running | 0 | 47m ","description":"Backups are essential for databases.

This chapter lists the most important components and their respective purposes.\nBasically, the CPO project focusses on the main tasks of each individual component. This means that each component does what it does best and only that. In addition to reliable operation, this should also ensure efficient development and project management that utilises existing approaches rather than fighting against them.\n1. CYBERTEC-pg-operator The CYBERTEC-pg-operator is a Kubernetes operator that automates the operation and management of PostgreSQL databases on Kubernetes clusters. It facilitates the provisioning, scaling, backup and recovery of PostgreSQL clusters and integrates tools such as Patroni and pgBackRest for high availability and backup management.\nThe main focus of the operator is the creation of the necessary templates and objects for Kubernetes, the regular check whether the declarative description of the cluster is still up to date and for the implementation of various tasks in the cluster, which were commissioned by the user.\n2. Kubernetes Kubernetes is an open source platform for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications. It enables the management of container clusters in different environments and offers functions such as automatic load balancing, self-healing and rollouts. Kubernetes ensures that applications are always available and scalable and provides a framework for managing infrastructure in a cloud-native environment.\nThe focus of Kubernetes in the context of CPO is the use of the operator\u0026rsquo;s templates to create the required objects. For example, the statefulset controller creates the desired pods based on the template. Kubernetes or the respective controllers monitor the generated objects independently and react if they are missing or do not correspond to the template. This means, for example, that pods that have been removed are automatically regenerated even if the operator is not currently running. This avoids the operator as a single point of failure.\n3. Patroni Patroni is an open source tool for managing PostgreSQL high availability clusters. It uses a distributed consensus mechanism, often based on Etcd, Consul or Zookeeper, to manage the role of the PostgreSQL primary node and perform automatic failovers. Patroni ensures that only one primary database server is active at a time, enabling consistency and availability of PostgreSQL databases in a cluster.\nThe focus of Patroni is to build, configure and monitor the PostgreSQL cluster based on the configuration created by the operator. Patroni therefore takes over all tasks such as leader selection, cluster monitoring, auto-failover and much more independently. Patroni is included in every PostgreSQL container and therefore pod and focussed on the individual cluster. This means that cluster management is guaranteed even without a currently running operator and therefore runs independently of the operator. This avoids the operator as a single point of failure.\n4. PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It is known for its reliability, robustness and compliance with SQL standards. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types, functions and offers extensive customisation options. It is suitable for applications of any size and offers strong support for ACID transactions and Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC).\nThe main role of PostgreSQL in the context of CPO is quite clear. Controlled by Patroni, PostgreSQL takes care of its task as a DBMS.\n5. pgBackRest pgBackRest is a reliable backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL databases. It offers features such as incremental backups, parallel backup and restore, compression and encryption. pgBackRest is designed for use in large databases and offers both local and remote backup options. It integrates well into Kubernetes environments and enables automated and efficient backup strategies.\npgBackRest is configured based on the cluster manifest and therefore via the operator. Automatic backups, on the other hand, are based on Kubernetes cron jobs and are therefore independent of the operator, apart from the template generation by the operator.\n6. pgBouncer PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. It reduces the load on the database server by consolidating and efficiently managing incoming client connections. PgBouncer improves the performance and scalability of PostgreSQL-based applications by reducing the number of active connections while enabling fast switching times between different connections.\n","description":"Various software components are used to operate CPO.

As part of the declarative mode of operation of the operator, these files are defined via the operator. The modifying intervention within the container also represents a contradiction to the immutability of the container.\nFor these reasons, the operator provides a way to make adjustments to the various files, from PostgreSQL to Patroni.\nWe differentiate between two main objects in the cluster manifest:\npostgresql with the child objects version and parameters patroni with objects for the pg_hab, slots and much more postgresql The postgresql object consists of the following elements:\nversion - allows you to select the major version of PostgreSQL used. parameters- enables the postgresql.conf to be changed spec: postgresql: parameters: shared_preload_libraries: \u0026#39;pg_stat_statements,pgnodemx, timescaledb\u0026#39; shared_buffers: \u0026#39;512MB\u0026#39; version: \u0026#39;16\u0026#39; Any known PostgreSQL parameter from postgresql.conf can be entered here and will be delivered by the operator to all nodes of the cluster accordingly.\nYou can find more information about the parameters in the PostgreSQL documentation\npatroni The patroni object contains numerous options for customising the patroni-setu, and the pg_hba.conf is also configured here. A complete list of all available elements can be found here.\nThe most important elements include\npg_hba - pg_hba.conf slots synchronous_mode - enables synchronous mode in the cluster. The default is set to false maximum_lag_on_failover - Specifies the maximum lag so that the pod is still considered healthy in the event of a failover. failsafe_mode Allows you to cancel the downgrading of the leader if all cluster members can be reached via the Patroni Rest Api. You can find more information on this in the Patroni documentation pg_hba The pg_hba.conf contains all defined authentication rules for PostgreSQL.\nWhen customising this configuration, it is important that the entire version of pg_hba is written to the manifest. The current configuration can be read out in the database using table pg_hba_file_rules ;.\nFurther information can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation\nslots When using user-defined slots, for example for the use of CDC using Debezium, there are problems when interacting with Patroni, as the slot and its current status are not automatically synchronised to the replicas.\nIn the event of a failover, the client cannot start replication as both the entire slot and the information about the data that has already been synchronised are missing.\nTo resolve this problem, slots must be defined in the cluster manifest rather than in PostgreSQL.\nspec: patroni: slots: cdc-example: database: app_db plugin: pgoutput type: logical This example creates a logical replication slot with the name cdc-example within the app_db database and uses the pgoutput plugin for the slot.\nATTENTION: Slots are only synchronised from the leader/standby leader to the replicas. This means that using the slots read-only on the replicas will cause a problem in the event of a failover.\n","description":"Users who are already used to working with PostgreSQL from Baremetal or VMs are already familiar with the need for various files to configure PostgreSQL.

This means that, apart from the limits specified by the administrators, the workloads can use the required resources of the worker node very dynamically.\nThe cluster manifest is used to define the Postgres pod resources via the typical resources objects.\nThere are basically two different definitions:\nrequests: Basic requirement and guaranteed by the worker node limits: maximum availability, allocation is increased dynamically if the worker node can provide the resources. For the planning of the cluster, a proper definition should be carried out in terms of the required hardware, which is then defined as requests. These resources are thus guaranteed to the cluster and are taken into account when deploying the pod. Accordingly, a pod can only be deployed on a worker if it can provide these resources. Any limits beyond this are not taken into account when deploying.\nThe unit of measurement should be taken into account when planning the necessary CPUs: cpu specifications are based on millicores\n1 cpu corresponds to 1 core 1 core corresponds to 1000 millicores (m) 1/2 core corresponds to 500 m resources: limits: cpu: 500m memory: 1Gi requests: cpu: 1000m memory: 1Gi This example corresponds to a guaranteed availability of half a core and 1 Gibibyte. However, if necessary and available, the container can use up to one core. The allocation takes place dynamically and for the required time.\nPods can be categorised into three Quality of Services (QoS) based on the defined information on the resources.\nBest-Effort: The containers of a pod have no resource information Burstable: A container of the pod has a memory or CPU requests or limits. Guaranteed: Each container of a pod has both cpu and memory requests and limits. In addition, the details of the respective limits correspond to the requests details If you would like more information and explanations, you can take a look at the Kubernetes documentation on QoS.\nWe generally recommend using the Guaranteed Status for PostgreSQL workloads. However, many users very successfully use the deviation of the CPU limit by factors such as 2. For example:\nresources: limits: cpu: 1000m memory: 1Gi requests: cpu: 2000m memory: 1Gi This is intended to create the possibility of additional CPU resources for sudden load peaks.\nHINT: The use of burstable definitions does not release you from a correct resource calculation, as limits resources are not guaranteed and therefore an undersupply can occur if the requests are not properly defined.\n","description":"Kubernetes workloads are often deployed without a direct resource definition.

Users have login rights and inherit the other rights from the NOLOGIN role.\nNoLogin roles (defaultRoles) The roles are created if defaultroles is not explicitly set to false.\nspec: preparedDatabases: appl_db: extensions: dblink: public schemas: data: {} This creates roles for the schema owner, writer and reader\nLogin roles (defaultUsers) The roles described in the previous paragraph can be assigned to LOGIN roles via the users section in the manifest. Optionally, the Postgres operator can also create standard LOGIN roles for the database and each individual schema. These roles are given the suffix _user and inherit all rights from their NOLOGIN counterparts. Therefore, you cannot set defaultRoles to false and activate defaultUsers at the same time.\nspec: preparedDatabases: appl_db: defaultUsers: true extensions: dblink: public schemas: data: {} history: defaultRoles: true defaultUsers: false This example creates the following users and inheritances\nRole name Attributes inherits from appl_db_owner Cannot login appl_db_reader,appl_db_owner,appl_data_owner,\u0026hellip; appl_db_owner_user appl_db_owner appl_db_reader Cannot login appl_db_reader_user appl_db_reader appl_db_writer Cannot login appl_db_reader appl_db_writer_user appl_db_writer appl_db_data_owner Cannot login appl_db_data_reader,appl_db_data_writer appl_db_data_reader Cannot login appl_db_data_writer Cannot login appl_db_data_reader appl_db_history_owner Cannot login appl_db_history_reader,appl_db_history_writer appl_db_history_reader Cannot login appl_db_history_writer Cannot login appl_db_history_reader Default access permissions are also defined for LOGIN roles when databases and schemas are created. This means that they are not currently set if defaultUsers (or defaultRoles for schemas) are activated at a later time.\nUser Secrets For each user created by cpo with LOGIN permissions, the operator also creates a secret with username and password, as with the creation of roles via the users object.\n","description":"CPO not only supports you in deploying your cluster, it also supports you in setting it up in terms of the database and users.

This section explains why high availability is important for PostgreSQL and how Patroni acts as a solution to ensure HA. Why High Availability (HA) for PostgreSQL?\nTo minimise downtime: In modern, data-driven applications, downtime can cause significant financial and reputational losses. High availability ensures that the database remains available even in the event of hardware failures or network problems. Data integrity and security: A database failure can lead to data loss or data inconsistencies. High-availability solutions protect against such scenarios through continuous data replication and automatic failover. Scalability and load balancing: HA setups make it possible to distribute the load across multiple nodes, resulting in better performance and faster response times. This is particularly important in environments with high data traffic. Ease of maintenance: By setting up high availability, database maintenance can be performed without interrupting services. Nodes can be maintained incrementally while the database remains available. Patroni - the cluster manager In our PostgreSQL environment, we use Patroni in the PG containers by default. This has the advantage that even single-node instances basically function as Patroni clusters. This configuration offers several important advantages:\nEasy scalability: by using Patroni in all PG containers, scaling pods up and down is possible at any time. You can easily add additional pods as needed to improve performance or increase capacity, or remove pods to free up resources. This flexibility is particularly useful in dynamic environments where requirements can change quickly. Automated cluster management: Patroni automatically takes over the management of the cluster. When a new pod is added to an existing cluster, Patroni takes care of setting up the new node itself, including initialising and starting replication. This means you don\u0026rsquo;t have to perform any manual steps to configure or manage new nodes - Patroni does it all for you automatically. Seamless integration: As Patroni is active in every PG container by default, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about compatibility or manual configuration. This makes deployment and maintenance much easier, as all the necessary components are already preconfigured. Optimisation of resources: Even with a minimal setup (single-node instance), you benefit from the advantages of a Patroni cluster, including the possibility of easy expansion and automatic failover in the event of a failure. This ensures optimal resource utilisation and minimises downtime. Upgrade the cluster to high availability The necessary changes to a high-availability cluster are very limited. Only the number of desired instances needs to be increased.\napiVersion: cpo.opensource.cybertec.at/v1 kind: postgresql metadata: name: cluster-1 spec: dockerImage: \u0026#34;docker.io/cybertecpostgresql/cybertec-pg-container:postgres-16.4-1\u0026#34; numberOfInstances: 2 postgresql: version: \u0026#34;16\u0026#34; resources: limits: cpu: 500m memory: 500Mi requests: cpu: 500m memory: 500Mi volume: size: 5Gi You can either create a new cluster with the document or update an existing cluster with it.

A complete list of all available elements can be found here.\nThe most important elements include\npg_hba - pg_hba.conf slots synchronous_mode - enables synchronous mode in the cluster. The default is set to false maximum_lag_on_failover - Specifies the maximum lag so that the pod is still considered healthy in the event of a failover. failsafe_mode Allows you to cancel the downgrading of the leader if all cluster members can be reached via the Patroni Rest Api. You can find more information on this in the Patroni documentation pg_hba The pg_hba.conf contains all defined authentication rules for PostgreSQL.\nWhen customising this configuration, it is important that the entire version of pg_hba is written to the manifest. The current configuration can be read out in the database using table pg_hba_file_rules ;.\nFurther information can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation\nslots When using user-defined slots, for example for the use of CDC using Debezium, there are problems when interacting with Patroni, as the slot and its current status are not automatically synchronised to the replicas.\nIn the event of a failover, the client cannot start replication as both the entire slot and the information about the data that has already been synchronised are missing.\nTo resolve this problem, slots must be defined in the cluster manifest rather than in PostgreSQL.\nspec: patroni: slots: cdc-example: database: app_db plugin: pgoutput type: logical This example creates a logical replication slot with the name cdc-example within the app_db database and uses the pgoutput plugin for the slot.\nATTENTION: Slots are only synchronised from the leader/standby leader to the replicas.

This process is handling the connection. On the positive side, this enables a stable connection and isolation, but it is not particularly efficient for short-lived connections due to the effort required to create them.\nHow Connection Pooling solves this problem With connection pooling, the application connects to the pooler, which in turn maintains a number of connections to the PostgreSQL database. This makes it possible to use the connections from the pooler to the database for a long time instead of short-lived connections and to recycle them accordingly.\nIn addition to utilising long-term connections, a ConnectionPooler also makes it possible to reduce the number of connections required to the database. For example, if you have 3 application nodes, each of which maintains 100 connections to the database at the same time, that would be 300 connections in total. The application usually does not even begin to utilise this number of connections. With the pgBouncer, this can be optimised so that the applications open the 300 connections to the pgBouncer, but the pgBouncer only generates 100 connections to PostgreSQL, for example, thus reducing the load by 2/3.\nHINT: It is important to correctly configure the bouncer and thus the connections to be created between pgBouncer and PostgreSQL so that enough connections are available for the workload.\nHow does this work with CPO CPO relies on pgBouncer, a popular and above all lightweight open source tool. pgBouncer manages individual user-database connections for each user used, which can be used immediately for incoming client connections.\nHow do I create a pooler for a cluster? connection_pooler.number_of_instances - How many instances of connection pooler to create.

With Multisite, both clusters benefit from the well-known Patroni features such as automatic failover and demotion of members, resulting in a significant extension compared to a conventional standby cluster. This feature significantly improves high availability and redundancy by managing multiple geographically or infrastructurally separated clusters as one logical unit. This allows one cluster to seamlessly transition to another in the event of a failure without having to rely on manual switchovers or third-party replication solutions.\nPrerequisites In order to set up the multisite PostgreSQL operator you will need the following:\nTwo or more Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters (also possible with bare metal or VMs) Kubernetes version 1.25+, OpenShift version 4.12+. Support for defining LoadBalancer services with external IP addresses that are accessible from the other cluster(s). Persistent volumes with must be available (only ReadWriteOnce capability is needed). A separate VM or Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster to provide quorum (if using less then three Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters). For high availability there should not be a shared point of failure between the quorum and the two Kubernetes clusters. VM or a LoadBalancer IP must be accessible on ports 2379/2380 to the two other clusters. 2 vCPU and 2 GB of memory and 20GB of persistent storage is needed for the quorum site. Set up etcd cluster with 3 sites accessible from each of the sites. etcd needs to support API version 3. For backups an object storage system with S3 compatible API is needed. Minio, Ceph and major cloud provider object storages are known to work. An additional etcd is set up for Multisite, which spans the Kubernetes or Openshift clusters and must contain the quorum. Architecture Helm based deployment of the multisite operator contains two helm charts, postgres-operator and postgres-cluster. The first is used to deploy the operator and associated objects to a single Kubernetes cluster. The operator is responsible for managing PostgreSQL clusters based on Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) of type postgresqls/pg.\nThe diagram contains in green the Helm charts that are used to deploy operator and clusters, in blue the objects deployed by the operator helm chart and in gold the objects deployed by the cluster chart.\nOperator helm chart deployed objects have the following purposes:\ndeployments/postgres-operator - Deployment for the operator itself. opconfig/postgres-operator - Operator configuration parameters that are read on operator startup. These apply to all clusters managed by this operator. crd/operatorconfigurations.cpo.opensource.cybertec.at - Schema for the operator configuration. clusterrole/postgres-operator - Defines the Kubernetes API resource access used by the operator. Assigned to postgres-operator service account. clusterrole/postgres-pod - The Kubernetes API access needed by database pods. Access is needed to access leader status, config and other things. This is assigned to postgres-pod service account used by database pods. crd/postgresqls.cpo.opensource.cybertec.at - Schema for PostgreSQL cluster definitions. clusterrole/postgres-operator:users:{admin,edit,view} - If rbac.createAggregateClusterRoles is set then user facing roles are added for accessing the postgresqls CRDs. The cluster chart creates an instance of postgresqls CRD, which will be called cluster manifest from here on. When this cluster manifest is created operator will create the needed resources for the cluster. These include:\nstatefulset/$clustername - StatefulSet is responsible for creating and managing database pods and their associated PersistentVolumeClaims for storing the databases. Each database pod will run internally an instance of Patroni process, which will coordinate over the Kubernetes API initialization of the database, startup, leader election and other control plane actions.\nservice/$clustername,endpoints/$clustername - The main access point for users accessing the database. When load balancer is enabled in the CRD or multisite mode is enabled, this service will be set to be a LoadBalancer service and accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster. The service is created without a selector. Instead, for leader elections database pods will update the IP address of this endpoint to point to the current leader.\nThe endpoint also holds annotations that determine the duration of the leader lease.\nIn multicluster operation mode the standby site leader will be in read-only mode.\nservice/$clustername-repl - Service that points to non-leader (read-only) instances of the database cluster.\nservice/$clustername-config - A headless service with an endpoint that holds Patroni configuration in annotations.\npoddisruptionbudget/postgres-$clustername-pdb - A pod disruption budget that does not allow Kubernetes to shut down pods in leader role. On some Kubernetes clusters kubernetes.enable_pod_disruption_budgets may need to be turned off to allow nodes to be drained for upgrades.\nCreate the CA The first step is to create a custom CA. An organisation name is required for this. You can also add further details about the country, district and location. The CA serves as the central authority that signs the certificates and thus guarantees the correctness of the certificate. In order to successfully complete the verification of a certificate, the CA\u0026rsquo;s certificate must be stored on the client system.\nORGANIZATION=MyCustomOrganization CA=$ORGANIZATION-RootCA mkdir $CA cd $CA # Creating the CA-Key openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -out $CA.key -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:secp384r1 -pkeyopt ec_param_enc:named_curve -aes256 # Creating the CA-Certificate openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key $CA.key -sha512 -days 1826 -out $CA.crt -subj \u0026#34;/CN=${ORGANIZATION} Root-CA/C=AT/ST=Lower Austria/L=Woellersdorf/O=${ORGANIZATION}\u0026#34; Create a custom Certificate The server needs a certificate signed by a CA and a private key so that it can claim to be trustworthy.\nIt is important that the CA certificate is stored as trustworthy with the client. Otherwise, no certificate check is possible.

There are two different options here. For the first option, a secret is created that contains all the necessary information. I.e.\nServer certificate Private server key CA certificate In the second variant, the CA certificate is separated and written in a separate secret. The advantage of this is that the CA only needs to be saved once and changed in the event of an update. First Option: Using one secret for all three objects kubectl create secret generic cluster-1-tls \\ --from-file=tls.crt=$CN.crt \\ --from-file=tls.key=$CN.key \\ --from-file=ca.crt=$CA.crt Finally, the definition is made in the cluster manifest so that the operator adapts the cluster.\napiVersion: \u0026#34;cpo.opensource.cybertec.at/v1\u0026#34; kind: postgresql ... metadata: name: cluster-1 spec: tls: secretName: \u0026#34;cluster-1-tls\u0026#34; caFile: \u0026#34;ca.crt\u0026#34; Second Option: Using a separat Secret for the CA kubectl create secret generic cpo-root-ca --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt kubectl create secret generic cluster-1-tls \\ --from-file=tls.crt=$CN.crt \\ --from-file=tls.key=$CN.key \\ Finally, the definition is made in the cluster manifest so that the operator adapts the cluster.\napiVersion: \u0026#34;cpo.opensource.cybertec.at/v1\u0026#34; kind: postgresql metadata: name: cluster-1 spec: tls: secretName: \u0026#34;cluster-1-tls\u0026#34; caSecretName: \u0026#34;cpo-root-ca\u0026#34; caFile: \u0026#34;ca.crt\u0026#34; A regular check of the mounted certificates takes place automatically within the container. This check takes place every 5 minutes. If the certificates have been updated, the certificates are loaded automatically.\nIn addition to generating the certificates independently, cert-manager can also be used for this purpose.
